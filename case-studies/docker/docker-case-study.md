## Introduction

Docker takes away repetitve, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud. Docker's comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

## Brief History

- **Origins:** Docker was born in 2013, created by Solomon Hykes. It was initially an internal project at dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company. The project was open-sourced and released to the public in March 2013.
- **Early Popularity:** Docker quickly gained traction in the developer community due to its novel approach to containerization. It built upon existing Linux container technologies like LXC but introduced a more user-friendly interface and efficient container management.
- **Docker, Inc.** The growing interest and demand for Docker led to the establishment of Docker, Inc. (formerly known as dotCloud, Inc.). In 2013, Solomon Hykes co-founded the company to support and further develop the Docker project. Docker, Inc., received significant funding, helping to fuel Docker's rapid growth.
- **Standardization and Partnerships:** Docker rapidly emerged as a de facto standard for containerization. Major technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM recognized Docker's potential and started supporting it in their platforms and cloud services.
- **Docker Hub:** Docker introduced Docker Hub, a cloud-based registry, in 2014. Docker Hub allowed developers to share, distribute, and discover Docker images, contributing to the vibrant Docker ecosystem.
- **Docker Compose and Swarm:** In 2014, Docker released Docker Compose, a tool that simplified the definition and management of multi-container applications. Around the same time, Docker Swarm was introduced, providing native clustering and orchestration capabilities for Docker.
- **Containerd and CNCF:** In 2017, Docker donated its container runtime, containerd, to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Containerd became a core component of the container ecosystem, fostering collaboration and standardization.
- **Competition and Kubernetes:** As Docker's popularity soared, Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform initially developed by Google, gained momentum. Although Docker and Kubernetes were initially seen as competitors, they eventually found synergy, and Kubernetes could manage Docker containers seamlessly.
- **Ecosystem Growth:** The Docker ecosystem continued to expand with various tools and services aimed at streamlining container management, security, and deployment. Docker remained a significant player, but the containerization market saw the rise of other container runtimes and orchestration solutions.

## Features

Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.

### Main Features

- **Containerization:** Docker enables the creation and encapsulation of applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, making them consistent and easily deployable across various environments.
- **Isolation:** Containers ensure that applications run in isolated environments, preventing conflicts between dependencies and improving security by limiting access to the host system.
- **Image-based Deployment:** Docker uses images, which are snapshots of a container with all the necessary files and configurations. These images can be shared and reused, promoting consistency and scalability in deployments.
- **Scalability:** Docker allows you to scale applications quickly by effortlessly spinning up multiple containers based on the same image, providing a flexible and efficient solution for varying workloads.
- **Version Control:** Docker allows versioning of images, enabling developers to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and maintain a history of their application configurations.
- **Easy Management:** Docker provides a simple and user-friendly command-line interface and graphical tools to manage containers, networks, and storage volumes.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration:** Docker integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, streamlining the development process and accelerating software delivery.
- **Platform Independence:** Docker containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, promoting a "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

## Market Comparison
