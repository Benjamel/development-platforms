## Introduction

Docker takes away repetitve, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud. Docker's comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

## Brief History

- 1990: Examples are invented by John Doe.
- 1991: Examples are first used in Example Project.
- 1996: Example Project is released to the public.
- 1999: John Doe steps down as CEO of Example Company.
- 2001: E.G. Group acquires Example Company for $1.23 billion.
- 2009: Anonymous leaks database of politically sensitive Examples to the public.
- 2010: E.G. Group open sources Example Project and all proprietary Examples.

## Features

Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.

### Main Features

- **Containerization:** Docker enables the creation and encapsulation of applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, making them consistent and easily deployable across various environments.
- **Isolation:** Containers ensure that applications run in isolated environments, preventing conflicts between dependencies and improving security by limiting access to the host system.
- **Image-based Deployment:** Docker uses images, which are snapshots of a container with all the necessary files and configurations. These images can be shared and reused, promoting consistency and scalability in deployments.
- **Scalability:** Docker allows you to scale applications quickly by effortlessly spinning up multiple containers based on the same image, providing a flexible and efficient solution for varying workloads.
- **Version Control:** Docker allows versioning of images, enabling developers to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and maintain a history of their application configurations.
- **Easy Management:** Docker provides a simple and user-friendly command-line interface and graphical tools to manage containers, networks, and storage volumes.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration:** Docker integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, streamlining the development process and accelerating software delivery.
- **Platform Independence:** Docker containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, promoting a "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

## Market Comparison

This section can be used to compare the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen tool to other similar tools. You may use subheadings, tables or bullet points to structure your description.

If you are writing about an open source tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar proprietary tools. Likewise, if you are writing about a proprietary tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar open source tools.

Similarly, a self hosted tool and a cloud based tool with a similar purpose may make for a good comparison.

## Getting Started

If applicable, describe how to get started with your chosen tool. By providing examples, this can help to demystify a tool and make it more accessible to beginners.
